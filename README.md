# Welcome!

We're excited to start receiving your feedback about FSPY Desktop. To get started, please read this overview of how to submit your feedback.

## Submitting Feedback

There are two ways to give us your feedback and tell us about any bugs you find:

### 1. Submitting Feedback Through your portal (easiest option)

Inside your FSPY Desktop portal you'll see a tab with the Feedback Label. Clicking this tab will bring up a screen which asks you what type of feedback you'd like to submit. The two types of feedback that you can submit are:

* General
* Specific

You'll also be asked to categorize the feedback that you're giving. These categories are:

* Question
* Problem
* Suggestion
* Other
	
After you submit your feedback, an issue will automatically be opened in our GitHub Repo. We've already sent you an email invitation to join our GitHub team, and we encourage you to accept that invitation, that way you can follow the issue you created and we can talk about it with you right from the ticket.

### 2. Submitting Feedback Directly Through GitHub

Let's say that you jotted down all of your feedback on a notepad and you want to share it with us. If this was the case, you can create separate issues right from within our GitHub repo - just pay attention to the labels you are giving each issue you create.
